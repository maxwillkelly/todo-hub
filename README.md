# TodoHub - The GovernorHub Developer Test

## Introduction

TodoHub is a simple "todo list" application in need of some love and care. TodoHub in its current iteration has the ability to list todo items, as well as add new todo items, but in need for it to become usable it needs some extra functionality.

## Commit Messages

At GovernorHub we like to use a common language for our commit messages, we follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification when possible. This provides an nice and easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history. It also allows us to be more consistent as a team.
