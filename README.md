# TodoHub - The GovernorHub Developer Test

## Introduction

TodoHub is a simple "todo list" application in need of some love and care. TodoHub in its current iteration has the ability to list todo items, as well as add new todo items, but in need for it to become usable it needs some extra functionality. Your job is to implement that extra functionaility, you are also welcome to dazzle us with any extras you have up your sleeve, within the time alloted.

## The Stack

TodoHub is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework, and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) as a component library, however, the test is designed to be completed by developers who have no experience in these libraries. The idea being that the skeleton of the application and the instructions in this **README** being enough to carry out the tasks required. _Note: This is a very similar, if not the same sort of stack that we use on the front end at GovernorHub, on our main product and new developments_

## Getting Started

To get started, fork this repository... etc etc etc (will complete with full steps once I do it myself to make sure its as little pain as possible)

## Commit Messages

At GovernorHub we like to use a common language for our commit messages, we follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification when possible. This provides a nice and easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history. It also allows us to be more consistent as a team.
