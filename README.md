# TodoHub - The GovernorHub Developer Test

## Introduction

TodoHub is a simple "todo list" application in need of some love and care. TodoHub in its current iteration has the ability to list todo items, as well as add new todo items, but in need for it to become usable it needs some extra functionality. Your job is to implement that extra functionaility, you are also welcome to dazzle us with any extras you have up your sleeve, within the time allocated.

This **README** goes through a lot of details about this application and what we expect / are asking from you, but we must stress that we are more interested about the way you solve the problems, than your knowledge of the stack.

We have added extra details (such as commit message standards etc) because we want to give you a good idea of our standards and the way we work, if you have any views on them (good or bad), it would be great to hear what you think.

At GovernorHub we think its important to strive to write the best software, using the most suitable tools, with the most efficient processes for the project.

## The Stack

TodoHub is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework, with [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) as a component library using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the coding language (_gosh that's a mouthful_).

Despite this, the test is designed to be completed by developers who have no experience in these libraries, and can most definitely be completed by those who have only experienced Javascript rather than Typescript. (_Typescript is a super-set of Javascript, so Javascript can be used just fine with no issues_).

The idea is that the skeleton of the application and the instructions in this **README** are enough to carry out the tasks required.

_Note: This is very similar to the front-end stack we use at GovernorHub, on our main product and new developments_

## Getting Started

To get started, fork this repository... etc etc etc (will complete with full steps once I do it myself to make sure its as little pain as possible)

## Commit Messages

At GovernorHub we like to use a common language for our commit messages, we follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification when possible. This provides a nice and easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history. It also allows us to be more consistent as a team.
